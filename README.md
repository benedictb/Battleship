# Battleship

Battleship is a clone of the popular board game of the same name written in MATLAB, created by a team of myself and four other team members as the semester project for he Introduction to Engineering Systems II class at the University of Notre Dame. 

Since MATLAB isn't optimized for working with intricate GUIs like the gameboard in Battleship, displaying the inital board after choosing ship placements may take several minutes.

*Note: The GUI design of this project was optimized for Apple computers, and, while functional on Windows and Linux, the actual GUI doesn't display properly on those operating systems.*

## Installation
---
To play Battleship, simply run the `battleship.m` script found in the root of the repository.

## Features
---
#### Custom sprites
In addition to "water", "hit" and "miss" sprites, each ship has a set of custom sprites that gives the board a unique feel. The game also has custom Victory and Defeat images that display at the end of a match.

#### Ship Placement Flexibility
For a quick game, you can choose to randomly place your ships, or place them manually for a more strategic approach.

#### Full GUI
No need to play battleship in the terminal with this full-color, multi-state GUI.

#### Various Difficulties
Includes easy, medium, hard, and "cheating" modes. The hard is tough, but cheating mode looks at your ship placements to make guesses for the ultimate edge.

#### Game Simulator
Interested in comparing the strength of the different algorithms? The Game Simulator mode allows you to compare any two of the algorithms in any number of simulation games. Simply pick the number of games and the different AI modes and the program will simulate the games and display the results in succinct graphs.
